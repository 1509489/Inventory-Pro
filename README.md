## Why is Inventory Pro being open-sourced?

After years on the AssetStore, we're open-sourcing Inventory Pro because we're moving on to new projects and tools. You can read more in our blog post.

100% in the hands of the community, we hope to see the tool flourish, development continue, and any upcoming bugs fixed (the tool should be bug-free as-is).

## What's included with Inventory Pro?

#### Multiple Inventories

#### Advanced currency system

#### Controller support

#### Full mobile support
Inventory Pro works across PC, mobile, and consoles, allowing you full freedom to port games using Inventory Pro to most platforms.

#### Crafting
Inventory Pro makes it easy to create crafting systems. The standard crafting system can of course be inherited from and overridden to modify certain aspects of the crafting process. For example, if you want to add another collection to scan for potential items the user would require.

#### Restrictions
Restrict your collections to types, weight, dragging, (un)stacking and more. This allows you to create a collection that can only hold consumable items, only quest items or both.

#### Item Layouts
Allow each item to take up a specified amount of space in your collections. For example, allow a shield to take up a 2x2 slot while an apple only takes a 1x1 slot.

#### Cooldowns
Categories can be given a cooldown, all items sharing this category will all go into cooldown when an item from this category is used. Of course you can override the cooldown per item.

#### Collections
Easily create your own collections, simply drag on a component, play with the settings in the inspector and voila. The skillbar uses references, and sums up the total amount of items in the inventories.

#### Filters
Filter collections (any window with items in it). For example when you create multiple inventories (which is very possible) you can filter one to only allow quest items. 

#### Vendors
Buying and selling from vendors, such as an in-game NPC, is made easy - and with Inventory Pro, you can tweak each vendor right inside the Unity inspector.

It doesn't get easier than that.

#### Cleanup
Sort, re-stack and tidy up your collections with a simlpe click of a button. The sorting algorithm can be tweaked to your liking to sort based on any paramter or type.

#### Use items to restore stats

#### Complete design included
