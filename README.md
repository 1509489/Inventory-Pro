## Why is Inventory Pro being open-sourced?

We're open-sourcing Inventory Pro because we have had to move on to new projects and tools. You can read more in our blog post.

100% in the hands of the community, we hope to see the tool flourish, development continue, and any upcoming bugs fixed (the tool should be bug-free as-is).
